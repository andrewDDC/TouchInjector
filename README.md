# TouchInjector
TouchInjector is a Windows 8/10 desktop application that generates 
Windows Touch events from incoming [TUIO](http://www.tuio.org/) messages. You may speak of it as 
a virtual 'multi-touch driver', though it is technically not a driver. You can download the latest binary release v1.2 [here](https://github.com/mkalten/TouchInjector/releases/download/1.2/TouchInjector-1.2.zip).
